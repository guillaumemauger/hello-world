# hello-world

testing out git / github and python

initial goal: figure out how to use/share ipython notebooks

--

accomplished so far:
(1) created new repository, with dummy README file
(2) ran "git clone" to get it on local machine
(3) added a new file, ran "git add". "git status" says it needs to be committed
(4) modified README, ran "git add" on it so it's 'staged' for commit
(5) committed new changes

TO DO:
(1) Figure out how to get an ipython notebook up for viewing
(2) Work on understanding version control/branching/etc.
